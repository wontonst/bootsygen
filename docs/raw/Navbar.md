#Instructions
#The navbar is divided into "categories." For instance, on the left side of this page, you can see that the page links are separated by small headers. These are set in config.php. The order which you set them in config.php will be the order that they appear in.

Each page must have a "category." This is set on the first line of the markdown file in the format

<pre>
#my category

my content goes here
</pre>

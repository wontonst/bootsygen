#Macros

Page macros were created because it's too ugly to have a lot of HTML code in the contents section. Macros are written in the following fashion
```
$(MACRONAME,parameter1,parameter2,parameter3)
```

Note that the <b>macro must be on its own line</b>. Each macro has its own specified parameters.
The list of macros available are listed below.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Macro Name</th>
<th colspan="2">Parameters</th>

<tr>
<td>IMG</td>
<td>image href</td>
<td>image alt</td>
</tr>
